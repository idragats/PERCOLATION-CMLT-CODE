# PERCOLATION

In this part we create a CMLT code on C to simulate the percolation problem. We calculate the distribution of clusters by varying the quantity of probability p, where p expresses the probability in which every position it will become 1. (1-p, is the probability for a position it will become as value 0). 
In this section the value of p can be changing from 0.1 to 0.8 with step Δp = 0.1, except the region of the critical point where the step have change into Δp = 0.01. 
finally we calculate the Ιav and Iav', the Iav' is the same with Iav without the bigest cluster, also we calculate the pmax and the critical exponents β,γ,γ', 
creating teh corresponding graphs on matlab.
